# README.md Generator

* A simple program that runs in the console using Node.js to create a README.md file based on input collected from the user.

## Usage
* To run the program, simply navigate to the proper directory that contains your clone of index.js
* Then run the command <node index> or <node index.js> and follow the prompts in the terminal.
* The newly created README.md file will appear in the <dist> folder
